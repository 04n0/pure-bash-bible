# Introduction

A collection of pure `bash` alternatives to external processes and programs. The `bash` scripting language is more powerful than people realise and you can accomplish most tasks without the need or dependency of external programs.

Calling an external process in `bash` is expensive and excessive use will cause a noticeable slowdown. By sticking to built-in methods (*where possible*) your scripts and programs will be faster, require less dependencies and you'll gain a better understanding of the language itself.

The contents of this book provide a reference for solving the problems encountered when writing programs and scripts in `bash`. The examples are in function format showcasing how to incorporate these solutions into your code.
